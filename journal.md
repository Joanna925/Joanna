Different kind of work online could be paid by different sponsors depends on who is requiring the work. For example national security department would be paying companies to sensor the search history or chat history from people's devices.
Once the platforms are invented, they should be doing all the calculations and generating the outcome online instead of people operating it.
When we use the platforms to download or converting works, we have to be cautious of the content we are accessing or downloading, because it might be violating other people's privacy or it might also be considered as hacking.
Carleton's library makes thousands of books available online for students to read, it allows students to search, access, and download materials in the library without going to there.
Also, ever since the quarantine started and everything moved online, culearn allows professors to record the lectures for students in case they cannot catch up the class. The content becomes accessable online for students without time limit.
I personally don't think there is any obstacles that make the process complicate or confusing.
